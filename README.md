## 详细使用方法
Enable it in .ini first (**bEnableFirstPersonMode**), then while in game press the lookaround/first person mode key (**T** is the default key).

Due to how MH2 works, either a static like camera (which has no Y axis movement and restricts mouse) or 360 camera can be used at a time. To
temporarily switch to the 360 camera, hold **Z** (can be changed in PluginMH2.ini). This will allow full mouse movement to an extend. 
Camera might be glitchy after this, just press the lookaround/first person mode key again to "fix" it. Aiming will automatically toggle 360 camera as long as aim is held.

FOV can be changed in the .ini file.

*First person executions can be enabled by enabling bDisableExecutionCamera in the INI.*

# Notes

- Firearms Execution Unlock is only a code toggle! Extra assets might be required to make this work 100%!
